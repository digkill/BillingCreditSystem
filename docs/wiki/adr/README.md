# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Use this directory to track significant architectural decisions. Each file should follow the conventional ADR template:

```
# ADR 0001: Title
- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
...

## Decision
...

## Consequences
...
```

Create new records using sequential numbering (e.g., `0001-initial-service-boundaries.md`).
