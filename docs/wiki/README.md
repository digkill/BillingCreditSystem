# Billing Credit System Wiki

Welcome to the knowledge base for the Billing Credit System. Use this space to orient new contributors, document architectural decisions, and keep operational guidance close to the code.

## Table of Contents

- [System Architecture](architecture.md) – Monorepo layout, bounded contexts, data flows, cross-cutting concerns.
- [Platform Components](components.md) – Service-level documentation for CRM API, Risk Engine, Web UI, and supporting infrastructure.
- [Deployment Guide](deployment.md) – Environments, build pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code entry points.
- [Operations & Maintenance](operations.md) – Runbooks, observability standards, backups, and ongoing servicing.
- [ADR Index](adr/README.md) *(planned)* – Keep architectural decision records for future changes.

> 📌 **Maintain-as-code mindset:** treat this wiki as part of the product. Update it with every meaningful code change to minimise institutional knowledge loss.
